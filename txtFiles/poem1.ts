  `We all make mistakes`,
  `By Brenden Bushman`,
  ``,
  `Our hill was beautiful once.`,
  `Its respite forever clouded by the veil that tears my eyes`,
  `With waves of broken memories I'm pushed ever closer to that fateful cliff`,
  ``,
  `With tempests of forlorn reminders I'm pulled back to a time long lost`,
  `Had I only known this permanence would be the cost`,
  ``,
  `When crimson needles wafted wistfully through the silent air`,
  `Your absence made my heart unravel in despair`,
  ``,
  `My shattered thoughts whir with regrets I can't suppress`,
  `As echoes of your voice call me to join you in eternal rest`,
  ``,
  `For all we ever were, is lost because of me.`,
